## Getting Started

1. Install CrewAI via pip: `pip install crewai crewai-tools`.
2. Define your agents with specific roles, goals, and backstories that guide their behavior and expertise.
3. Create tasks with clear descriptions and assign them to appropriate agents with expected output formats.
4. Assemble a crew, configure the process type (sequential or hierarchical), and kick off the workflow.

## Key Features

- **Role-based agents** let you define specialized team members with distinct expertise, goals, and behavioral guidelines.
- **Task delegation** allows agents to autonomously delegate subtasks to other agents in the crew when needed.
- **Sequential and hierarchical processes** support both linear pipelines and manager-orchestrated team structures.
- **Built-in tool integration** provides agents with web search, file operations, code execution, and custom tool access.
- **Memory and learning** agents maintain context across tasks and learn from previous interactions within a session.
- **Production-ready** with CrewAI Enterprise offering deployment, monitoring, and scaling for production agent workflows.
