## Getting Started

1. **Install via pip** — Run `uv pip install langflow -U` in a Python 3.10–3.13 environment, or download Langflow Desktop for Windows/macOS with no dependency setup required.
2. **Launch the UI** — Start the local server and open the visual canvas in your browser to begin composing a flow.
3. **Build your workflow** — Drag and drop LLM nodes, vector store connectors, prompt templates, and tool integrations onto the canvas and wire them together.
4. **Deploy** — Expose your finished flow as a REST API, export it as JSON for use in Python apps, or deploy it as an MCP server for use with MCP clients.

## Key Features

- **Visual drag-and-drop builder** — Compose complex LLM pipelines without writing boilerplate, with an interactive playground for real-time testing and iteration.
- **Full Python source access** — Every component exposes its Python source, allowing developers to customize behavior beyond what the UI offers.
- **Multi-agent orchestration** — Build multi-agent systems with conversation management and retrieval-augmented generation out of the box.
- **API and MCP server deployment** — Any workflow can be instantly served as a REST API endpoint or as a tool for Model Context Protocol clients.
- **Broad integrations** — Supports all major LLMs, vector databases, and observability tools including LangSmith and LangFuse.
- **Desktop app** — Langflow Desktop bundles all dependencies for Windows and macOS, enabling zero-configuration local use.
