## Getting Started

1. **Install Langflow** — Run `uv pip install langflow -U` with Python 3.10–3.13, or download Langflow Desktop for Windows/macOS with no dependency setup required.
2. **Launch the UI** — Start the local server and open the visual canvas in your browser to begin building your first flow.
3. **Build your workflow** — Drag and drop components (LLMs, vector stores, tools, prompts) onto the canvas and connect them to create your agent or pipeline.
4. **Deploy and integrate** — Export your flow as a REST API, MCP server, or JSON file to embed it into any application or framework.

## Key Features

- **Visual builder** — Drag-and-drop canvas lets you assemble complex AI workflows without writing boilerplate code
- **Source code access** — Every component is customizable in Python, giving developers full control when needed
- **Interactive playground** — Test and debug flows step-by-step in real time before deploying
- **Multi-agent orchestration** — Supports conversation management, retrieval, and coordination across multiple agents
- **API and MCP server export** — Turn any workflow into a callable API endpoint or Model Context Protocol server automatically
- **Broad integrations** — Works with all major LLMs, vector databases, and observability tools like LangSmith and LangFuse
