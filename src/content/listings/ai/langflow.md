## Getting Started

1. **Install Langflow** — Run `uv pip install langflow -U` in a fresh directory (requires Python 3.10–3.13), or download Langflow Desktop for Windows or macOS with no environment setup needed.
2. **Launch the server** — Start the local server and open the visual builder in your browser to begin assembling your flow.
3. **Build your workflow** — Drag and drop components (LLMs, vector stores, tools, agents) onto the canvas and connect them visually, customizing any node with Python if needed.
4. **Deploy and integrate** — Export your flow as a REST API, JSON file, or MCP server to embed it into any application or framework.

## Key Features

- **Visual flow builder** — Drag-and-drop canvas lets you compose complex AI pipelines without writing boilerplate code
- **Multi-agent orchestration** — Build and coordinate multiple agents with conversation management and retrieval-augmented generation
- **Python customization** — Access and edit the source code of any component directly within the platform
- **API and MCP server deployment** — Every workflow can be instantly served as a REST endpoint or an MCP server for tool-calling clients
- **Broad integrations** — Supports all major LLMs, vector databases, and observability tools like LangSmith and LangFuse
- **Interactive playground** — Test and debug flows step-by-step in real time before deploying to production
