tagline: "Visual low-code platform for building and deploying AI agents and workflows"
description: "Langflow is an open-source platform that lets developers build AI-powered agents and workflows using a drag-and-drop visual interface, with full Python source code access for customization. It supports all major LLMs and vector databases, and every workflow can be deployed as a REST API or MCP server. It includes multi-agent orchestration, an interactive playground, and integrations with observability tools like LangSmith and LangFuse."

## Getting Started

1. **Install Langflow** — Run `uv pip install langflow -U` in a Python 3.10–3.13 environment, or download Langflow Desktop for Windows/macOS with no setup required.
2. **Launch the interface** — Start the local server and open the visual builder in your browser to begin creating a new flow.
3. **Build your workflow** — Drag and drop components (LLMs, vector stores, tools, prompts) onto the canvas and connect them to define your agent logic.
4. **Deploy or integrate** — Export your flow as a REST API endpoint or MCP server to embed it in any application or framework.

## Key Features

- **Visual builder** — Drag-and-drop canvas lets you compose complex AI pipelines without writing boilerplate code
- **Python customization** — Every component exposes its source code, so you can override or extend behavior directly in Python
- **Multi-agent orchestration** — Build systems with multiple cooperating agents, conversation memory, and retrieval-augmented generation
- **API and MCP deployment** — Instantly expose any workflow as a REST API or Model Context Protocol server for downstream tools and clients
- **Interactive playground** — Test and debug flows step-by-step in real time before deploying to production
- **Broad integrations** — Works with all major LLMs, vector databases, and observability platforms including LangSmith and LangFuse
