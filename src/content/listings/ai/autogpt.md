description: "AutoGPT is one of the original autonomous AI agent frameworks, providing a platform to create and manage AI agents that automate complex, multi-step workflows. It supports self-hosting via Docker or a cloud-hosted option, and is built to be extensible so developers can create custom agents on top of it."

## Getting Started

1. **Install prerequisites** — Ensure Docker (20.10+), Docker Compose (2.0+), Node.js (16+), Git, and npm are installed on your system.
2. **Run the setup script** — On macOS/Linux, run `curl -fsSL https://setup.agpt.co/install.sh -o install.sh && bash install.sh` to set up locally in minutes.
3. **Configure your agents** — Use the platform UI or config files to define agent workflows, connect LLM providers, and set automation triggers.
4. **Deploy and monitor** — Run your agents continuously and monitor their progress through the built-in dashboard.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous agents** — Agents can break down complex goals into subtasks and execute them without constant human input
- **Self-hosting support** — Fully run the platform on your own infrastructure using Docker Compose at no cost
- **Cloud-hosted option** — A managed cloud beta is available for those who prefer not to self-host
- **Extensible architecture** — Build custom agents and workflows on top of the open-source platform
- **Multi-OS support** — Runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL2)
- **Active community** — Large open-source community with contributions, plugins, and integrations
