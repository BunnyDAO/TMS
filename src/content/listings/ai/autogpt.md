description: "AutoGPT is one of the original autonomous AI agent frameworks, enabling users to create and run AI agents that complete multi-step tasks with minimal human intervention. It provides a full platform for defining agent workflows, connecting tools, and deploying agents either self-hosted via Docker or through a cloud-hosted beta. Built in Python, it supports multiple LLMs and is designed for developers who want to automate complex, long-horizon tasks."

## Getting Started

1. **Install prerequisites** — Ensure you have Docker (20.10+), Docker Compose (2.0+), Git, Node.js (16+), and npm installed on your system.
2. **Run the setup script** — On macOS/Linux, run `curl -fsSL https://setup.agpt.co/install.sh -o install.sh && bash install.sh` to get up and running quickly.
3. **Configure your agents** — Define agent workflows, connect tools, and set your LLM API keys through the platform interface.
4. **Deploy and monitor** — Launch your agents locally or join the waitlist for the cloud-hosted beta to run agents without managing infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous task execution** — Agents break down high-level goals into steps and execute them with minimal human input, handling multi-step workflows end to end.
- **Self-hosting support** — Run the full platform on your own hardware using Docker Compose, keeping your data and workflows under your control.
- **Cloud-hosted option** — A managed cloud beta is available for users who prefer not to handle infrastructure setup themselves.
- **Multi-LLM compatibility** — Supports various large language models, giving you flexibility over which AI backend powers your agents.
- **Extensible tooling** — Agents can be connected to external services and APIs, enabling real-world actions like web search, file manipulation, and more.
- **Active open-source community** — One of the most-starred AI projects on GitHub, with ongoing development, multilingual documentation, and a large Discord community.
