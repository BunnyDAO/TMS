## Getting Started

1. **Install prerequisites** — Ensure you have Docker Engine 20.10+, Docker Compose 2.0+, Git, Node.js 16+, and npm 8+ installed on your system.
2. **Run the setup script** — On macOS/Linux, run `curl -fsSL https://setup.agpt.co/install.sh -o install.sh && bash install.sh` to set up the platform automatically.
3. **Configure your environment** — Add your LLM API keys and configure agent settings through the provided interface or environment files.
4. **Build and run agents** — Use the platform UI or CLI to define agent workflows, connect tools, and deploy agents to run autonomously.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous agents** — Agents execute multi-step tasks independently, chaining actions together without requiring human input at each step.
- **Self-hostable** — Full self-hosting support via Docker Compose, giving you complete control over your data and infrastructure.
- **Cloud-hosted option** — A managed cloud beta is available for users who prefer a no-setup experience.
- **Workflow automation** — Connect agents to external tools and APIs to automate complex, real-world workflows end to end.
- **Multi-platform support** — Runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL2), with hardware requirements suitable for most developer machines.
- **Active open-source community** — Backed by a large Discord community and regular updates from the Significant Gravitas team.
