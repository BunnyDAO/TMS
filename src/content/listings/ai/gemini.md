## Model Lineup

- **Gemini 2.5 Pro** — Google's most capable model. 1M+ token context, frontier reasoning, strong coding, and the highest scores on many benchmarks.

- **Gemini 2.0 Flash** — Previous gen, still available and highly capable for general use.

## Key Features

- **1M+ token context window** — Analyze entire codebases, long documents, hours of video, or audio in a single prompt. The longest context of any frontier model.
- **Native multimodal** — Understands text, images, audio, video, and code natively in a single model — not bolted-on capabilities.
- **Deep Research** — Agentic multi-step research mode that browses the web, synthesizes information, and produces comprehensive reports with citations.
- **Google Search grounding** — Answers are backed by real-time Google Search results, providing factual, up-to-date information with source links.
