## Model Family

- **Claude Opus 4.6** — The most powerful model. Excels at complex reasoning, long autonomous coding sessions, multi-step research, and tasks requiring deep expertise. Ideal for Claude Code and agentic workflows.
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5** — The everyday workhorse. Fast, highly capable, and the best balance of intelligence and speed. Great for coding, analysis, and creative work.
- **Claude Haiku 4.5** — Ultra-fast and cost-effective. Perfect for classification, summarization, customer support, and high-volume API use cases.

## Key Features

- **200K token context window** — upload and analyze entire codebases, books, legal documents, or research papers in a single conversation.
- **Extended thinking** — models can reason step-by-step through complex math, logic, and multi-step problems before responding, dramatically improving accuracy.
- **Tool use and function calling** — Claude can call external APIs, query databases, search the web, and chain multiple tools together to complete tasks.
- **Vision and multimodal input** — upload images, screenshots, PDFs, charts, and diagrams for analysis, extraction, and description.
- **Artifacts and Projects** — generate and iterate on code, documents, and visualizations in a dedicated canvas workspace. Organize conversations with custom system prompts per project.
- **Enterprise-ready** — SOC 2 Type II certified, HIPAA eligible, with team plans, SSO, admin controls, and usage analytics.
- **System prompts and steering** — deeply customizable behavior through system prompts, constitutional AI training, and fine-grained content policies.
