## Getting Started

1. Create an account at [runpod.io](https://runpod.io) and add credits via credit card or cryptocurrency.
2. Launch a GPU pod by selecting your desired GPU type (A100, H100, RTX 4090, etc.) and a pre-built template.
3. Connect to your pod via SSH, Jupyter Notebook, or VS Code for interactive development and training.
4. Deploy a serverless endpoint for production inference by uploading your model and configuring autoscaling.

## Key Features

- **Competitive GPU pricing** offers A100s, H100s, and consumer GPUs at prices significantly below major cloud providers.
- **Serverless GPU endpoints** deploy inference APIs with automatic scaling, pay-per-second billing, and zero cold starts.
- **Pre-built templates** provide one-click deployment of popular frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Stable Diffusion.
- **Spot and on-demand instances** choose between cheaper interruptible spots or guaranteed on-demand GPU access.
- **Network storage** persistent volumes that survive pod restarts for storing datasets, checkpoints, and model weights.
- **Community cloud** access to a distributed network of GPU providers for additional capacity and competitive pricing.
