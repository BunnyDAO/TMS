4. Use **Tab autocomplete** while coding for fast, context-aware inline suggestions.

## Key Features

- **Cascade agentic flows** — Autonomously plans and executes multi-step coding tasks across multiple files. Reads your codebase, writes code, runs terminal commands, and self-corrects.
- **Flows and Write modes** — Choose between autonomous agent execution (Flows) and interactive pair programming (Write) depending on the task.
- **Fast autocomplete** — Context-aware code suggestions that predict your next edit based on your project structure and coding patterns.
- **Acquired by OpenAI** — Now part of OpenAI's ecosystem, bringing deep integration with GPT and o-series models.
- **Full VS Code compatibility** — All your extensions, themes, and keybindings work out of the box. Zero migration friction.
- **Real-time codebase awareness** — Indexes your entire project for contextually relevant suggestions, answers, and edits.
- **Generous free tier** — Substantial free usage for individual developers, making it accessible without commitment.
- **Multi-model support** — Works with various AI models including GPT-4, Claude, and others.
