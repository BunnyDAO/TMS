## Getting Started

1. Download from [cursor.com](https://cursor.com) — available on macOS, Windows, and Linux. One-click import of all your VS Code settings, extensions, and keybindings.
2. Open a project and start typing — Tab autocomplete immediately predicts your next edit with multi-line suggestions based on codebase context.
3. Use **Cmd+K** (inline edit) to select code and describe changes in plain English for instant refactoring.
4. Open **Composer** (Cmd+I) for multi-file editing — describe a feature or refactor and Cursor makes changes across your project.

## Key Features

- **Tab prediction** — Goes far beyond autocomplete. Predicts multi-line edits, cursor movements, and even which file you'll edit next based on your patterns and codebase context.
- **Composer** — Multi-file editing mode. Describe a feature, bug fix, or refactor in natural language and Cursor generates a diff across multiple files with full project awareness.
- **Agent mode** — Autonomous task completion. Give Cursor a goal and it reads files, writes code, runs terminal commands, fixes errors, and iterates until the task is done.
- **Inline editing (Cmd+K)** — Select code, describe what you want changed, and get instant inline diffs. Perfect for quick refactors, type changes, and bug fixes.
- **Multi-model support** — Choose between Claude Opus/Sonnet, GPT-4, o3, Gemini, and other models. Switch models per-task based on what works best.
- **Codebase indexing** — Automatically indexes your entire project for contextually relevant suggestions, answers, and edits.
- **Full VS Code compatibility** — All your extensions, themes, keybindings, and settings work exactly as before. Zero switching cost.
- **@-mentions for context** — Reference specific files, docs, URLs, or symbols with @ to give the AI exactly the context it needs.
