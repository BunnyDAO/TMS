4. For API access, go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) to get your API key.

## Model Lineup

- **GPT-4.1** — The latest fast multimodal model. Strong at coding, instruction following, and long-context tasks. Available in standard, mini, and nano variants.
- **o3** — OpenAI's most powerful reasoning model. Uses extended "thinking" for complex math, science, coding, and multi-step problems.
- **o4-mini** — Fast, efficient reasoning model. Great balance of intelligence and speed for everyday tasks.
- **Codex (codex-1)** — OpenAI's autonomous coding agent. Runs in a cloud sandbox, reads your full repo, writes and edits code, runs tests, and creates PRs on GitHub. Works asynchronously — assign tasks and come back to finished work. Based on o3, fine-tuned with RLHF for software engineering.
- **GPT-4o** — Previous generation multimodal model, still widely used and available.

## Key Features

- **Codex coding agent** — Connect your GitHub repo and assign coding tasks in natural language. Codex clones your codebase into a sandboxed environment, writes code, runs your test suite, iterates on failures, and opens a PR when done. Multiple tasks run in parallel.
- **Deep reasoning with o3** — Extended thinking mode that works through complex problems step-by-step before responding, dramatically improving accuracy on hard tasks.
- **Multimodal I/O** — Text, images, audio, video, and file uploads in a unified chat interface. Generate images with DALL-E 3 inline.
- **Real-time web search** — Searches the internet for current information, news, prices, and events when needed.
- **Code Interpreter** — Executes Python in a sandboxed environment for data analysis, charting, file conversion, and computation.
- **Canvas** — A side-by-side editing workspace for writing and code, where you can collaborate with ChatGPT on documents and programs.
- **Custom GPTs** — Create and share tailored AI assistants with specific instructions, knowledge files, and API actions. Browse the GPT Store for community-built specialists.
- **Memory** — Remembers your preferences, projects, and context across conversations for more personalized responses.
- **Voice mode** — Real-time spoken conversations with natural-sounding voice synthesis and understanding.
- **Operator and deep research** — Agentic features that browse the web, perform multi-step research, and complete tasks autonomously.
