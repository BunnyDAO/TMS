## Getting Started

1. Install LangChain via pip: `pip install langchain langchain-openai` (or your preferred provider package).
2. Set up your LLM provider API key and create a simple chain to test the connection.
3. Build a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline by adding a vector store and document loaders.
4. Use LangGraph for complex agentic workflows with cycles, branching, and persistent state.

## Key Features

- **Modular architecture** with composable components for chains, prompts, memory, retrievers, and output parsers.
- **LangGraph** provides a graph-based framework for building stateful, multi-step agent workflows with cycles.
- **LangSmith observability** offers tracing, evaluation, and monitoring for debugging and optimizing LLM applications.
- **Extensive integrations** connect to 100+ LLM providers, vector stores, document loaders, and embedding models.
- **RAG support** includes built-in tools for document ingestion, chunking, embedding, and retrieval-augmented generation.
- **Python and JavaScript** available in both Python and TypeScript/JavaScript with feature parity across both libraries.
- **Latest release** — Updated February 2026 with continued improvements to LangGraph, integrations, and LangSmith tooling.
