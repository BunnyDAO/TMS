## Getting Started

1. Visit [v0.dev](https://v0.dev) and sign in with your Vercel or GitHub account.
2. Describe the UI component or page layout you want, or upload a screenshot or wireframe for reference.
3. Review the generated React component with live preview and iterate by describing adjustments.
4. Copy the generated code into your project or deploy directly via the Vercel integration.

## Key Features

- **Natural language to UI** generates complete React components from plain English descriptions of your desired interface.

- **shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS** generates code using industry-standard component libraries for clean, maintainable output.
- **Live preview** shows an interactive rendering of the generated component in real-time as you iterate.
- **Production-ready output** creates accessible, responsive components you can copy directly into your codebase.
- **Iterative refinement** lets you describe changes and modifications to incrementally improve the generated UI.
