## Getting Started

1. Visit [bolt.new](https://bolt.new) and sign in with your account to access the AI app builder.
2. Describe the web application you want to build in natural language — be as specific as possible about features and design.
3. Watch as Bolt generates the full project structure, installs dependencies, and runs the app in a live preview.
4. Iterate on the design and functionality by chatting with Bolt, then deploy to Netlify with one click.

## Key Features

- **Full-stack generation** creates complete applications with frontend, backend, database schema, and API routes from a single prompt.
- **In-browser development** runs Node.js via WebContainers, so there is nothing to install or configure locally.
- **Live preview** shows your running application in real-time as changes are made, enabling rapid iteration.
- **One-click deployment** ships your application to Netlify or other hosting providers directly from the browser.
- **Framework support** generates apps using React, Next.js, Astro, Vue, and other popular web frameworks.
- **Open-source core** allows self-hosting and community contributions through the public GitHub repository.
