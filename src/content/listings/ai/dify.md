## Getting Started

1. Self-host Dify using Docker Compose: `docker compose up -d` from the cloned repository, or sign up for Dify Cloud.
2. Configure your LLM provider API keys in the settings panel to connect Claude, GPT-4, or other models.
3. Create a new app using the visual workflow builder, choosing from chatbot, text generator, or agent templates.
4. Add knowledge bases for RAG by uploading documents, and publish your app with a shareable URL or API endpoint.

## Key Features

- **Visual workflow builder** enables drag-and-drop construction of complex LLM pipelines with branching and iteration.
- **Built-in RAG engine** with document ingestion, chunking, embedding, and retrieval for knowledge-grounded responses.
- **Multi-model support** connects to hundreds of LLM providers and lets you switch models without changing app logic.
- **Agent mode** builds autonomous agents with tool access, code execution, and web browsing capabilities.
- **One-click deployment** publishes apps as web interfaces, chat widgets, or API endpoints instantly.
- **Self-hostable** with full Docker support and enterprise features for data privacy and access control.
