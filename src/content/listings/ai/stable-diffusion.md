## Getting Started

1. Try Stable Diffusion online at [DreamStudio](https://dreamstudio.ai) or community platforms like Civitai for instant access.
2. Install locally using Automatic1111's WebUI or ComfyUI for full control over generation settings.
3. Download the latest SDXL or SD3 model weights from Hugging Face or Stability AI's official channels.
4. Explore community-created LoRAs and fine-tuned models on Civitai to achieve specific art styles and subjects.

## Key Features

- **Fully open-source** with weights and code available for unrestricted local use, modification, and redistribution.
- **Massive community ecosystem** with thousands of fine-tuned models, LoRAs, embeddings, and custom workflows.
- **ControlNet support** enables precise control over composition through pose, depth, edge, and other guidance methods.
- **Runs on consumer hardware** optimized for GPUs with 8GB+ VRAM, making high-quality generation accessible to everyone.
- **img2img and inpainting** transform existing images and selectively edit regions for precise creative control.
- **ComfyUI and WebUI** provide powerful node-based and traditional interfaces for building complex generation workflows.
