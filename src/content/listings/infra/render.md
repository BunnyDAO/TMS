name: "Render Network"
slug: "render"
tagline: "Decentralized GPU rendering network for AI and 3D content"
description: "Render Network is a decentralized GPU computing platform that connects creators needing rendering power with GPU node operators who have idle capacity. Originally built for 3D rendering, it has expanded to support AI inference and training workloads, creating a marketplace for distributed GPU compute."

## Getting Started

1. Visit [rendernetwork.com](https://rendernetwork.com) to learn about the network and its capabilities.
2. For creators, sign up as a creator and submit rendering jobs through compatible 3D software like OctaneRender.
3. For node operators, register your GPU node to provide rendering compute and earn RENDER tokens.
4. Acquire RENDER tokens (on Solana) to pay for rendering jobs or to participate in the network governance.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized GPU rendering** distributes rendering jobs across a global network of GPU nodes for faster completion.
- **AI compute support** expanding beyond 3D rendering to support AI model inference and training workloads.
- **Cost-effective** rendering on the decentralized network is significantly cheaper than centralized cloud GPU services.
- **OctaneRender integration** deep integration with OTOY's OctaneRender for professional-grade 3D rendering workflows.
- **RENDER token** used for network payments, staking, and governance on the Solana blockchain.
- **Burn-and-Mint Equilibrium** token economic model that ties network usage to token economics for sustainable growth.
