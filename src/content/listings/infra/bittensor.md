## Getting Started

1. Visit [bittensor.com](https://bittensor.com) to understand the subnet architecture and how miners and validators interact.
2. Install the Bittensor CLI: `pip install bittensor` and create a wallet with `btcli wallet create`.
3. Choose a subnet to participate in as either a miner (providing AI services) or a validator (evaluating quality).
4. Register on your chosen subnet and begin contributing compute, models, or data to earn TAO rewards.

## Key Features

- **Subnet architecture** specialized sub-networks compete on different AI tasks like text generation, image creation, and data analysis.
- **Incentivized AI development** miners earn TAO tokens by providing the best AI models and services within their subnet.
- **Yuma Consensus** unique consensus mechanism where validators evaluate and rank miner outputs for quality-based rewards.
- **Open marketplace** creates a competitive market for AI intelligence where the best models earn the most rewards.
- **Permissionless participation** anyone can create a new subnet, become a miner, or run a validator node.
- **TAO token economics** deflationary token model with halving emissions and staking requirements for network participation.
