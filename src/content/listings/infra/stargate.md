## Getting Started

1. Visit [stargate.finance](https://stargate.finance) and connect your wallet on the source chain.
2. Select the source and destination chains, choose the token to transfer, and enter the amount.
3. Confirm the transaction — Stargate provides instant guaranteed finality for cross-chain transfers.
4. For developers, integrate LayerZero's messaging protocol to build omnichain applications with the OApp framework.

## Key Features

- **Unified liquidity pools** shared pools across chains enable instant transfers without fragmented liquidity.
- **Guaranteed finality** cross-chain transfers are instant and final — no waiting for confirmations or risk of reverting.
- **Native asset transfers** send actual native tokens (USDC, USDT, ETH) instead of wrapped synthetic versions.
- **LayerZero messaging** the underlying protocol enables arbitrary cross-chain messages for any application logic.
- **Omnichain fungible tokens (OFT)** standard for deploying tokens that exist natively on all connected chains.
- **Wide chain support** operates across Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon, Avalanche, BNB Chain, and many more.
