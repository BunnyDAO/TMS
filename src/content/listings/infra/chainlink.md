## Getting Started

1. Browse available data feeds at [data.chain.link](https://data.chain.link) to find price feeds for your smart contract.
2. Integrate Chainlink Price Feeds by importing the AggregatorV3Interface and calling `latestRoundData()` in your contract.
3. Use Chainlink VRF for provably fair random number generation in gaming, NFTs, and lottery applications.
4. Set up Chainlink Automation (Keepers) to trigger smart contract functions based on time or custom conditions.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized price feeds** provide highly accurate, tamper-resistant price data for thousands of asset pairs across DeFi.
- **Chainlink VRF** generates cryptographically provable random numbers for fair gaming, NFT minting, and lotteries.
- **Automation (Keepers)** reliably triggers smart contract functions based on schedules, price thresholds, or custom logic.
- **CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol)** enables secure cross-chain token transfers and messaging.
- **Proof of Reserve** verifies that tokenized assets and stablecoins are properly backed by their claimed reserves.
- **Multi-chain deployment** operates across Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche, BNB Chain, and dozens more.
