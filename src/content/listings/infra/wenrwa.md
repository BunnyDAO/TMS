## Getting Started

1. Visit [wenrwa.com](https://wenrwa.com) and connect your Solana wallet (Phantom, Backpack, or Solflare).
2. Browse available RWA-linked tokens and tokenized asset opportunities.
3. Swap tokens and access real-world asset exposure directly on-chain.
4. Use Solana's fast, low-cost transactions — no bridging to Ethereum required.

## Infrastructure Role

- **RWA access layer** — WenRWA acts as infrastructure connecting traditional financial instruments to on-chain DeFi, making tokenized real-world assets accessible on Solana.
- **Cross-ecosystem bridge** — Bridges the gap between TradFi and DeFi without requiring users to interact with Ethereum's higher fees and slower settlement.
- **DeFi composability** — RWA tokens accessed through WenRWA plug into the broader Solana DeFi stack — lend on MarginFi, LP on Jupiter, or use as collateral.
- **Low-cost infrastructure** — Solana's negligible transaction costs make WenRWA practical for RWA interactions at any scale.

## Key Features

- **Tokenized RWA access** — Explore and trade tokenized real-world assets directly on Solana.
- **Token swapping** — Fast, low-cost swaps with minimal slippage powered by Solana's high throughput.
- **No bridging required** — Everything happens natively on Solana — no cross-chain friction or bridge risk.
- **Wallet integration** — Works with all major Solana wallets including Phantom, Backpack, and Solflare.
- **TradFi bridge** — Simplifies the journey from traditional finance instruments to on-chain DeFi opportunities.
