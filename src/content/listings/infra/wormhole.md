## Getting Started

1. Visit [portalbridge.com](https://portalbridge.com) to access Wormhole's token bridge interface for cross-chain transfers.
2. Connect your wallet for the source chain and select the destination chain and token to transfer.
3. Approve the transaction and wait for the guardian network to validate the cross-chain message.
4. For developers, integrate Wormhole's SDK to build cross-chain applications using the messaging protocol.

## Key Features

- **30+ chain support** connects Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Cosmos chains, and more.
- **Generic messaging** enables any data to be sent cross-chain, not just tokens — supporting cross-chain governance, oracles, and dApps.
- **Guardian network** 19 top-tier validators secure cross-chain messages through multi-signature attestation.
- **Native token transfers (NTT)** framework for transferring native tokens across chains while maintaining fungibility.
- **Wormhole Queries** read data from any connected chain without requiring an on-chain transaction.
- **Developer SDK** comprehensive TypeScript and Rust SDKs for building cross-chain applications and integrations.
