## Getting Started

1. Connect your wallet to Base by adding the network in MetaMask or using a Base-native wallet like Coinbase Wallet.
2. Bridge funds to Base from Ethereum using the official bridge at [bridge.base.org](https://bridge.base.org) or directly from Coinbase.
3. Explore the ecosystem at [base.org/ecosystem](https://base.org/ecosystem) for DeFi, social, gaming, and creator applications.
4. Deploy your own smart contracts using standard Ethereum tooling — Foundry, Hardhat, and Remix all work natively.

## Key Features
