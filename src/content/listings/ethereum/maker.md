## Getting Started

1. Visit [app.sky.money](https://app.sky.money) or [oasis.app](https://oasis.app) and connect your Ethereum wallet.
2. Open a Vault by depositing collateral (ETH, wBTC, stETH, or other approved assets) and generating DAI against it.
3. Monitor your Vault's collateralization ratio to keep it above the liquidation threshold.
4. Earn yield on DAI through the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) by depositing DAI into the savings module.

## Key Features

- **DAI stablecoin** a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin soft-pegged to the US dollar, used across all of DeFi.
- **Multi-collateral Vaults** deposit various crypto assets as collateral to generate DAI with flexible loan terms.
- **DAI Savings Rate (DSR)** earn yield on your DAI by depositing it into the protocol's savings contract.
- **Real-world asset collateral** pioneering the inclusion of tokenized real-world assets as Vault collateral types.
- **Decentralized governance** MKR token holders govern all protocol parameters including collateral types and risk settings.
- **Liquidation auctions** automated system ensures the protocol remains solvent by liquidating undercollateralized Vaults.
