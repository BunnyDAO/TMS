tagline: "Generalized shared security protocol for restaking on Ethereum"
description: "Symbiotic is a generalized shared security system that allows decentralized networks to bootstrap sovereign ecosystems by leveraging restaked assets on Ethereum. It enables protocols to access pooled economic security without giving up sovereignty over their own architecture. Symbiotic serves as infrastructure for networks that need cryptoeconomic guarantees without building security from scratch."

## Getting Started

1. **Connect your wallet** — Visit symbiotic.fi and connect an Ethereum-compatible wallet to access the protocol.
2. **Choose a vault** — Browse available vaults that support different collateral types and network operators.
3. **Deposit collateral** — Stake supported assets into a vault to begin providing shared security to participating networks.
4. **Manage positions** — Monitor your restaked positions, accrued rewards, and exposure to opted-in networks from the dashboard.

## Key Features

- **Generalized Restaking** — Supports a wide range of collateral types beyond ETH, including ERC-20 tokens, allowing flexible security provisioning.
- **Sovereign Network Design** — Decentralized networks can customize their slashing conditions, reward logic, and operator requirements without protocol-level constraints.
- **Modular Vault System** — Vaults are configurable and non-upgradeable by default, giving depositors predictable and transparent risk profiles.
- **Operator Network** — Operators can opt into multiple networks simultaneously, efficiently deploying staked capital across the ecosystem.
- **Non-Custodial** — Users retain control of their assets through smart contract-enforced rules with no centralized custody.
- **Permissionless Integration** — Any decentralized network can integrate Symbiotic to access pooled security without requiring approval from a central party.
