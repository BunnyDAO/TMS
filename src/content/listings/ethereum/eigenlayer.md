## Getting Started

1. Visit [app.eigenlayer.xyz](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz) and connect your Ethereum wallet.
2. Deposit your stETH, rETH, or other accepted LSTs into EigenLayer to begin restaking.
3. Delegate your restaked assets to an operator who runs validation software for Actively Validated Services (AVS).
4. Monitor your restaking position and rewards through the EigenLayer dashboard.

## Key Features

- **Restaking mechanism** allows existing ETH stakers to extend their cryptoeconomic security to additional protocols.
- **Actively Validated Services (AVS)** enables new protocols to bootstrap security from Ethereum's validator set.
- **Multiple asset support** accepts native ETH, liquid staking tokens (stETH, rETH, cbETH), and other approved assets.
- **Operator delegation** restakers can delegate to professional operators who manage the technical requirements.
- **Shared security marketplace** creates an open market where protocols purchase security from restakers.
- **Slashing conditions** defines programmable slashing for misbehavior, ensuring honest operation across all secured services.
