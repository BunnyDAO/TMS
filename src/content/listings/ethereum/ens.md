## Getting Started

1. Visit [app.ens.domains](https://app.ens.domains) and search for your desired .eth name to check availability.
2. Connect your Ethereum wallet and register the name — pricing is $5/year for 5+ character names.
3. Set your primary name to have it display across dApps, wallets, and Web3 platforms as your identity.
4. Configure records to point your ENS name to wallet addresses, websites, social profiles, and other metadata.

## Key Features

- **Human-readable addresses** replace long hex addresses with memorable names like "yourname.eth" for easy transactions.
- **Universal Web3 identity** ENS names are recognized across wallets, dApps, and platforms as your on-chain identity.
- **Decentralized websites** point ENS names to IPFS content hashes for censorship-resistant web hosting.
- **Multi-chain addresses** store receiving addresses for Bitcoin, Solana, and other chains under a single ENS name.
- **Profile and avatar** set a profile picture (including NFTs), bio, and social links on your ENS name.
- **Subnames** create unlimited subdomains (team.company.eth) for organizations, communities, and projects.
