## Getting Started

1. Acquire USDC from any major centralized exchange (Coinbase, Kraken, etc.) or swap for it on a DEX like Uniswap.
2. Store USDC in any Ethereum-compatible wallet like MetaMask, Rainbow, or a hardware wallet.
3. Use USDC across DeFi protocols for lending (Aave), trading (Uniswap), or yield strategies.
4. Bridge USDC across chains using Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) for native transfers.
