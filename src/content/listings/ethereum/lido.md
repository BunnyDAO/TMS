## Getting Started

1. Visit [stake.lido.fi](https://stake.lido.fi) and connect your Ethereum wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.).
2. Enter the amount of ETH you want to stake — there is no minimum requirement.
3. Approve the transaction and receive stETH in your wallet, which automatically rebases to reflect staking rewards.
4. Use your stETH across DeFi protocols for lending, liquidity provision, or as collateral while earning staking yield.

## Key Features

- **No minimum stake** stake any amount of ETH, removing the 32 ETH requirement for solo staking.
- **Liquid staking token (stETH)** represents your staked position and accrues daily staking rewards automatically.
- **DeFi composability** stETH is accepted as collateral across Aave, Maker, Curve, and hundreds of other protocols.
- **Distributed validators** stake is distributed across professional node operators to minimize centralization risk.
- **Daily rebasing** stETH balance updates daily to reflect earned staking rewards without any claiming required.
- **DAO governance** protocol decisions are made by LDO token holders through decentralized governance proposals.
