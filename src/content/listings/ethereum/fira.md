## Getting Started

1. **Connect your wallet** — Visit fira.money and connect a compatible Ethereum wallet such as MetaMask or WalletConnect.
2. **Choose a market** — Browse available fixed-rate markets and select the asset and term that fits your strategy.
3. **Lock your rate** — Deposit assets to borrow at a fixed rate or supply liquidity to earn fixed yield, locking in your terms onchain.
4. **Manage your position** — Monitor your position and exit anytime using the protocol's built-in exit mechanism.

## Key Features

- **Fixed-Rate Markets** — Borrow or lend at predictable, locked interest rates rather than variable rates that fluctuate with market conditions.
- **Sell Your Yield** — Lenders can sell their future yield upfront to receive immediate liquidity instead of waiting for interest to accrue.
- **Exit Anytime** — Positions are not strictly locked until maturity; users can exit early through the protocol's secondary mechanisms.
- **Permissionless** — Anyone can participate in or create fixed-rate markets without requiring approval or KYC.
- **Onchain Transparency** — All rate agreements and positions are settled and verifiable on the Ethereum blockchain.
