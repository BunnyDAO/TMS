## Getting Started

1. Visit [snapshot.org](https://snapshot.org) and browse existing spaces or create one for your own project or DAO.
2. Connect your wallet to verify your token holdings and voting power in spaces you are a member of.
3. Browse active proposals in your communities and cast gasless votes with your wallet signature.
4. Create proposals in spaces where you have the required permissions and token thresholds.

## Key Features

- **Gasless voting** all votes are signed messages stored off-chain, so participation costs nothing in gas fees.
- **Flexible voting strategies** supports token-weighted, one-person-one-vote, quadratic, and custom voting mechanisms.
- **Multi-chain support** calculates voting power from tokens on Ethereum, L2s, and other EVM chains.
- **Space customization** DAOs can configure their own branding, voting parameters, and proposal templates.
- **Delegation** token holders can delegate their voting power to trusted community members.
- **Open-source and free** completely free to use with no platform fees, supported by Snapshot Labs.
