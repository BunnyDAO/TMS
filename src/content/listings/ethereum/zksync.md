## Getting Started

1. Add zkSync Era to your wallet and bridge ETH from Ethereum at [bridge.zksync.io](https://bridge.zksync.io).
2. Transfer funds using the official bridge or third-party bridges like Orbiter for faster cross-chain transfers.
3. Explore DeFi on zkSync through protocols like SyncSwap, Maverick, and ReactorFusion.
4. Deploy contracts using standard Solidity tooling with the zkSync-specific compiler and Hardhat plugin.

## Key Features

- **Zero-knowledge proofs** provide cryptographic verification of every transaction, offering stronger security than optimistic rollups.
- **No withdrawal delays** ZK proofs enable instant finality without the 7-day challenge period of optimistic rollups.
- **Native account abstraction** built-in support for smart contract wallets, enabling gasless transactions and social recovery.
- **EVM compatibility** supports Solidity and Vyper smart contracts with the zkSync compiler for easy migration.
- **ZK Stack** enables launching custom ZK-powered chains (Hyperchains) with shared liquidity and interoperability.
- **Low fees** transactions cost a fraction of Ethereum mainnet while inheriting its full security guarantees.
