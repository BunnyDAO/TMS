## Getting Started

1. Add Optimism (OP Mainnet) to your wallet and bridge ETH from Ethereum at [app.optimism.io/bridge](https://app.optimism.io/bridge).
2. Explore the ecosystem at [optimism.io/apps](https://optimism.io/apps) for DeFi protocols, NFTs, and governance tools.
3. Participate in governance by delegating your OP tokens to delegates or voting directly on protocol proposals.
4. Build on Optimism using standard Ethereum tools — the OP Stack provides full EVM equivalence.

## Key Features

- **OP Stack** an open-source, modular rollup framework used by Base, Zora, Mode, and dozens of other chains.
- **Superchain vision** creating an interoperable network of OP Stack chains that share security, bridging, and sequencing.
- **Retroactive public goods funding** allocates protocol revenue to fund open-source projects and public goods.
- **Low transaction fees** with EIP-4844 blob support, transactions cost fractions of a cent.
- **Full EVM equivalence** supports all Ethereum smart contracts, tools, and libraries without modification.
- **Decentralized governance** through the Token House and Citizens' House bicameral governance structure.
