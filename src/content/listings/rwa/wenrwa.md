## Getting Started

1. Visit [wenrwa.com](https://wenrwa.com) and connect your Solana wallet (Phantom, Backpack, or Solflare).
2. Browse available RWA-linked tokens and tokenized asset opportunities.
3. Swap tokens and access real-world asset exposure directly on-chain.
4. Use Solana's fast, low-cost transactions — no bridging to Ethereum required.

## How WenRWA Fits the RWA Ecosystem

- **Solana-native RWA** — Most RWA protocols (Ondo, BlackRock BUIDL, Centrifuge) live on Ethereum. WenRWA brings real-world asset access to Solana, expanding the RWA market beyond Ethereum's ecosystem.
- **Lower barrier to entry** — Solana's near-zero fees make RWA accessible to users who can't justify Ethereum's gas costs for smaller positions.
- **DeFi composability** — RWA tokens accessed through WenRWA can be used across the broader Solana DeFi stack — lend on MarginFi, LP on Jupiter, or use as collateral.
- **Speed advantage** — Sub-second finality means RWA trades settle almost instantly, compared to minutes on Ethereum L1.

## Key Features

- **Tokenized RWA access** — Explore and trade tokenized real-world assets directly on Solana.
- **Token swapping** — Fast, low-cost swaps with minimal slippage powered by Solana's high throughput.
- **No bridging required** — Everything happens natively on Solana — no cross-chain friction or bridge risk.
- **Wallet integration** — Works with all major Solana wallets including Phantom, Backpack, and Solflare.
- **TradFi bridge** — Simplifies the journey from traditional finance instruments to on-chain DeFi opportunities.
- **Low fees** — Solana's negligible transaction costs make it practical to interact with RWA at any scale.
