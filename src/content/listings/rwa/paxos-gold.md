## Getting Started

1. Purchase PAXG directly from [paxos.com](https://paxos.com/paxgold) with USD or through major crypto exchanges like Kraken or Binance.
2. Store PAXG in any Ethereum-compatible wallet — each token represents exactly one troy ounce of gold.
3. Verify the gold backing by looking up your token's serial number to see the specific gold bar allocated to it.
4. Use PAXG in DeFi as collateral or trade it 24/7 on decentralized and centralized exchanges.
