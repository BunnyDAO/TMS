## Getting Started

1. Choose a Lightning wallet — Phoenix, Breez, or Muun for mobile; Alby for browser; or run your own node with LND or CLN.
2. Fund your Lightning wallet by sending on-chain Bitcoin or receiving a Lightning payment from another user.
3. Make your first Lightning payment by scanning a Lightning invoice QR code or paying a Lightning address.
4. For advanced users, run your own Lightning node with Umbrel or Start9 to participate in routing and earn fees.
