## Getting Started

1. Visit [babylonlabs.io](https://babylonlabs.io) and connect a compatible Bitcoin wallet to the staking interface.
2. Choose the amount of BTC you want to stake and select a finality provider to delegate to.
3. Sign the staking transaction from your wallet — your BTC remains on the Bitcoin network, not bridged elsewhere.
4. Monitor your staking position and rewards through the Babylon dashboard.

## Key Features

- **Native Bitcoin staking** lets BTC holders stake directly on the Bitcoin network without wrapping or bridging.
- **Self-custodial** stakers maintain control of their Bitcoin with cryptographic guarantees enforced by Bitcoin script.
- **Slashing mechanism** implements accountable security through extractable one-time signatures on Bitcoin.
- **Multi-chain security** staked Bitcoin provides economic security to multiple proof-of-stake chains simultaneously.
- **No minimum stake** allows any amount of Bitcoin to be staked, making participation accessible to all holders.
- **Bitcoin timestamping** uses Bitcoin's blockchain as a tamper-proof timestamp server for PoS chain checkpoints.
