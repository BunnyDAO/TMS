tagline: "Solana's deepest liquidity — concentrated & standard AMM pools powering Jupiter aggregation"
description: "Raydium is one of Solana's largest liquidity sources, providing both concentrated liquidity (CLMM) and standard AMM pools. Most of its volume flows through Jupiter's aggregation — when you swap on Jupiter, there's a good chance Raydium is providing the best route. It's also where pump.fun tokens graduate to when they hit market cap thresholds, making it the default first 'real' DEX for new Solana tokens."

## Getting Started

1. Visit [raydium.io](https://raydium.io) and connect your Phantom or Backpack wallet.
2. Swap tokens directly, or provide liquidity to earn trading fees from every swap routed through Raydium.
3. Choose between **Concentrated Liquidity (CLMM)** pools for capital-efficient LPing or **Standard AMM** pools for simplicity.
4. Monitor new token launches — pump.fun tokens automatically migrate to Raydium pools when they graduate.

## How Raydium Fits the Ecosystem

- **Jupiter aggregation** — Raydium is one of Jupiter's primary liquidity sources. A large portion of Solana swap volume routes through Raydium pools via Jupiter's smart routing.
- **pump.fun graduation** — When a meme coin on pump.fun hits its bonding curve cap (~$69K market cap), it automatically creates a Raydium pool. This is how tokens go from pump.fun to being tradeable across the entire Solana ecosystem via Jupiter.
- **Price feeds** — Raydium pools contribute to on-chain price discovery. Pyth Network and other oracles reference this liquidity for accurate pricing.
- **DeFi composability** — LP tokens from Raydium pools can be used in other protocols for additional yield (farming, lending collateral).

## Key Features

- **Concentrated Liquidity (CLMM)** — Provide liquidity within specific price ranges for dramatically higher capital efficiency and fee earnings. Similar to Uniswap V3 but on Solana's fast, cheap infrastructure.
- **Standard AMM pools** — Simple constant-product pools for straightforward LP. Lower maintenance but less capital-efficient.
- **pump.fun migration destination** — Automatic pool creation for graduated meme tokens, making Raydium the first "real" DEX stop for new tokens.
- **Token launchpad (AcceleRaytor)** — New projects can launch tokens with initial Raydium liquidity pools.
- **Farming rewards** — Earn additional token incentives on top of trading fees through incentivized liquidity pools.
- **Sub-second execution** — Leverages Solana's 400ms block times for near-instant trades with minimal gas costs.
