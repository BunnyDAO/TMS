## Key Features

- **Lending and borrowing** supply crypto assets to earn yield or borrow against collateral with flexible terms.
- **Isolated risk pools** separate lending pools with distinct risk parameters protect lenders from cross-asset contagion.
- **LST collateral support** accepts liquid staking tokens like JitoSOL and mSOL as collateral, enabling leveraged staking.
- **Competitive rates** dynamic interest rates based on pool utilization ensure fair pricing for both lenders and borrowers.
- **Points program** active engagement with the protocol earns points that may contribute to future governance participation.
- **Flash loans** borrow any amount without collateral within a single transaction for arbitrage and liquidation strategies.
