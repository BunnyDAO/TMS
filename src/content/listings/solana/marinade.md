## Getting Started

1. Visit [marinade.finance](https://marinade.finance) and connect your Solana wallet.
2. Choose between liquid staking (receive mSOL) or native staking (no token, direct delegation) based on your needs.
3. Stake your SOL and receive mSOL, which appreciates in value as staking rewards accrue.
4. Use mSOL across Solana DeFi protocols or hold it to passively earn staking yield.

## Key Features

- **Decentralization-focused** algorithmic delegation distributes stake across 400+ validators, strengthening the Solana network.
- **mSOL liquid staking** receive a liquid token representing your staked position that grows in value over time.
- **Native staking option** stake directly to Marinade's validator set without receiving a liquid token for simpler yield.
- **DeFi integration** mSOL is accepted across major Solana DeFi protocols for lending, LP, and collateral use.
- **Stake auction marketplace** validators compete for delegation by offering the best performance and commission rates.
- **MNDE governance** protocol decisions are made by MNDE token holders through decentralized governance.
