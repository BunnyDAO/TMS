description: "pump.fun is Solana's viral meme coin launchpad where anyone can create and trade tokens with no code. It uses a bonding curve for initial price discovery — when a token hits ~$69K market cap, it automatically graduates to a Raydium pool, making it instantly tradeable across the entire Solana ecosystem via Jupiter. It's the epicenter of Solana meme culture and has generated hundreds of millions in fees."

## Getting Started

1. Visit [pump.fun](https://pump.fun) and connect your Phantom or Backpack wallet with some SOL.
2. Browse the feed — tokens are sorted by market cap, volume, and age. Look for tokens with active communities.
3. Buy tokens directly on the bonding curve by selecting a token and entering your SOL amount.
4. To launch your own: fill in name, ticker, description, and image — it deploys instantly for ~0.02 SOL.

## How pump.fun Connects to the Ecosystem

- **Bonding curve → Raydium graduation** — Tokens start on pump.fun's internal bonding curve. When a token reaches ~$69K market cap and the bonding curve fills, it automatically migrates to a Raydium pool with locked liquidity. This is the most important handoff in the Solana meme ecosystem.
- **Jupiter aggregation** — Once a token graduates to Raydium, it becomes instantly tradeable through Jupiter, meaning every Solana wallet and trading interface can access it — including [WenRWA](https://app.wenrwa.com), where you can trade graduated tokens with AI-powered strategies.
- **Phantom integration** — Phantom wallet users can see pump.fun token balances, and Phantom's built-in swap (powered by Jupiter) can trade graduated tokens.
- **Jito MEV** — Active pump.fun traders often use Jito bundles for priority transaction inclusion, especially for early buys on new launches.
- **Helius tracking** — Developers use Helius webhooks to monitor pump.fun token launches, bonding curve progress, and graduation events in real-time.

## Key Features

- **Instant token creation** — Launch an SPL token in seconds with no coding. Just a name, ticker, image, and ~0.02 SOL.
- **Bonding curve mechanics** — Built-in price discovery that starts at zero and rises as more people buy. Fair launch — no pre-sales, no insider allocations.
- **Raydium graduation** — Tokens that reach the cap automatically get a Raydium pool with burned LP, providing permanent on-chain liquidity.
- **King of the Hill** — Featured placement for the token with the highest market cap on the bonding curve. Drives visibility and competition.
- **Live activity feed** — Real-time stream of buys, sells, new launches, and comments. Extremely addictive social trading experience.
- **Social features** — Comment threads, creator profiles, and reply chains on each token page create a social layer around trading.
