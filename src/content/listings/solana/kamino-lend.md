## Getting Started

1. **Connect your wallet** — Visit [kamino.finance](https://kamino.finance/) and connect a Solana-compatible wallet such as Phantom or Backpack.
2. **Supply assets** — Deposit supported tokens into a lending market to start earning variable interest from borrowers.
3. **Borrow against collateral** — Use your deposited assets as collateral to borrow other tokens while managing your loan-to-value ratio.
4. **Monitor positions** — Track your health factor and interest accrual in real time through the Kamino dashboard.

## Key Features

- **Peer-to-pool lending** — Assets are pooled together so lenders earn continuous yield while borrowers access liquidity instantly without a counterparty match.
- **Leverage strategies** — Users can loop borrow-supply positions to create leveraged exposure to assets, enabling more sophisticated yield and trading strategies.
- **Transparent onchain markets** — All interest rates, utilization ratios, and risk parameters are stored and computed onchain, ensuring full auditability.
- **Institutional-grade infrastructure** — Designed to serve both retail users and institutions, with robust security and audited smart contracts.
- **Multi-asset support** — Supports a range of Solana-native tokens and stablecoins across isolated and cross-collateral lending markets.
- **Real-time risk management** — Health factor monitoring and liquidation mechanisms protect the protocol and lenders from undercollateralized positions.
