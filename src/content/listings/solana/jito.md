description: "Jito serves two critical roles in the Solana ecosystem: liquid staking (JitoSOL) and MEV infrastructure (Jito Block Engine). JitoSOL is the largest liquid staking token on Solana, earning enhanced yields from both staking rewards and MEV tips. The Jito Block Engine is the backbone of Solana's block building — Jupiter routes MEV-protected trades through Jito bundles, and traders use it for priority transaction inclusion."

## Getting Started

1. Visit [jito.network](https://jito.network) and connect your Phantom or Backpack wallet.
2. Stake any amount of SOL — receive JitoSOL, which automatically accrues staking + MEV rewards.
3. Use JitoSOL across Solana DeFi: lend on MarginFi, LP on Jupiter/Orca/Meteora, or use as collateral.
4. Monitor your staking APY and MEV tip contributions on the Jito dashboard.

## How Jito Powers the Ecosystem

- **Jupiter MEV protection** — Jupiter routes trades through Jito bundles to protect users from sandwich attacks. When you swap on Jupiter with MEV protection enabled, it's Jito's Block Engine handling the execution.
- **Block building** — The Jito Block Engine is used by the majority of Solana validators. It orders transactions to capture MEV, and a portion of those tips flow back to JitoSOL holders.
- **pump.fun trading** — Traders sniping new pump.fun launches use Jito bundles for priority inclusion, paying tips that ultimately boost JitoSOL yields.
- **DeFi composability** — JitoSOL is accepted as collateral across MarginFi (lending), Drift (perps), Meteora (LP), and other protocols. You earn staking yield while using your SOL productively.

## Key Features

- **MEV-enhanced yields** — JitoSOL earns ~7-8% APY from staking rewards plus MEV tip redistribution, consistently higher than vanilla staking.
- **Jito Block Engine** — The infrastructure layer for Solana's MEV. Validators run the Jito client to capture MEV, and tips flow to JitoSOL holders and validators.
- **Jito Bundles** — Atomic transaction bundles that execute all-or-nothing. Used by Jupiter for MEV protection and by traders for priority execution.
- **Liquid staking token** — JitoSOL is freely transferable and usable across all of Solana DeFi while continuously earning yield.
- **No minimum stake** — Stake any amount of SOL to receive JitoSOL and start earning enhanced yields immediately.
- **Decentralized validator set** — Stake is distributed across 200+ high-performance validators to maintain network decentralization.
- **JTO governance token** — JTO holders govern the Jito protocol, including fee structures, validator delegation criteria, and MEV policies.
