## Getting Started

1. Install a Blinks-compatible wallet extension like Phantom or Backpack that supports rendering Actions.
2. Find Blinks shared on X (Twitter), Discord, or websites — they appear as interactive transaction cards.
3. Click the action button on a Blink to preview the transaction, then approve it in your wallet.
4. For developers, create your own Actions using the Solana Actions SDK and register them as Blinks.

## Key Features

- **Universal transaction links** share on-chain actions as URLs that work on any platform — social media, messaging, email.
- **Interactive previews** Blinks render as rich cards showing the action description, parameters, and transaction details.
- **No app switching** users complete on-chain transactions without leaving the website or social platform they are on.
- **Developer-friendly SDK** build custom Actions with the open-source SDK supporting TypeScript and Rust.
- **Wide action support** enables token swaps, NFT mints, donations, votes, staking, and any custom Solana transaction.
- **Dialect integration** Dialect's platform provides tooling for creating, managing, and distributing Blinks at scale.
